            <h3>Introduction</h3>
            <p>
                It is important to think both practically and sustainability when it comes to livelihood. To help communities cope with the changing weather patterns and ecosystem degradation, it needs to examine climate-resilient livelihoods, such as drought-resistant crops or sustainable fisheries management. Additionally, to address gender sensitive livelihood, such as the strategies and policies that support women and other disadvantaged groups. Lastly, the role of social protection programs in improving security, especially during crises. </p>

            <h3>Initiatives</h3>
            <p> 
                It aimed to detect Porcine Epidemic Diarrhea Virus (PEDV) among native pigs in Pampanga using the Reverse Transcription Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR) assay, a molecular technique known for its high accuracy in viral detection. Additionally, it investigated the effects of different feed combinations on the growth performance of pigs, finding that a mix of corn and roasted soybean, as well as corn and fermented soybean, resulted in better average daily gain and improved feed efficiency. Another aspect of the study focused on the gastrointestinal and respiratory conditions of BT-black native pigs, comparing those fed fermented versus unfermented soybean. The potential of soybean as an estrus enhancer was also explored, examining its impact on reproductive health in pigs. These findings contribute valuable insights into improving swine health and production efficiency.

            <h3>Recommendations</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Developing more effective vitamins or vaccines that would help to improve the health and reduce the need for antibiotics and a disease monitoring system in livestock in order to detect and control outbreaks of diseases that will improve the diagnostics and tracking technologies and those with diseases that can be seen immediately. Additionally, Livestock production can also improve feed efficiency and explore alternative feed ingredients.</li>
